1. This code contains data preprocessing, CNN model, model training and model testing functions.

2. In the code, GTSRB traffic road sign data directory is hard coded for local access, change it according to the local machine you want to run on.

3. The dataset is available publicly. The link to it is given in report and presentation references.

4. We have tried using many optimizers which have been commented in the code and only one can be uncommented at a time.

5. We trained the CNN model on Google Cloud Platform with a custom VM having GPU capabilities.

6. For training the model, comment the test code. For testing model, comment training code. 

7. The training will take a large amount of time on a regular non-GPU enabled PC since data is large.

8. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
